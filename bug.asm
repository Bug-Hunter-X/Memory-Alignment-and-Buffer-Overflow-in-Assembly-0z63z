```assembly
mov eax, [ebx + 0x10]
add eax, [ebx + 0x14]
mov [ebx + 0x18], eax
```
This code snippet demonstrates a potential issue related to memory alignment and access. If the memory location pointed to by `ebx` is not properly aligned, accessing `[ebx + 0x10]` and `[ebx + 0x14]` might lead to an exception or unexpected behavior, depending on the CPU architecture and operating system.  Specifically, if the data at those locations are not naturally aligned (e.g., trying to access a 4-byte integer on a 2-byte boundary), the CPU might throw an alignment fault. 

Another issue, although less obvious, is the potential for buffer overflow.  If the value in `ebx` is incorrect, the addition and assignment could write beyond the allocated memory, causing a crash or unpredictable results.
