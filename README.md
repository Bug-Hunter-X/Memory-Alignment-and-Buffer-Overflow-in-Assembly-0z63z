# Assembly Code: Memory Alignment and Buffer Overflow

This repository contains an example of assembly code that demonstrates potential memory alignment issues and buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The code snippet attempts to add two values from memory and store the result. However, it does not explicitly handle cases where memory might not be properly aligned or where the memory access might exceed allocated bounds.

**Challenges:**

* **Memory Alignment:** Accessing unaligned memory locations can lead to exceptions or incorrect results depending on the CPU architecture and OS.
* **Buffer Overflow:** If `ebx` points to an invalid memory location, writing to `[ebx + 0x18]` could overwrite other data, causing a crash or unpredictable behavior.

**Solution:**

The solution addresses these issues using proper memory alignment checks and bounds checking to prevent memory access violations. This emphasizes the importance of defensive programming even in low-level languages like assembly.

**Learning Points:**
* Importance of memory alignment in assembly programming
* Dangers of buffer overflow vulnerabilities
* Techniques for avoiding memory access violations
