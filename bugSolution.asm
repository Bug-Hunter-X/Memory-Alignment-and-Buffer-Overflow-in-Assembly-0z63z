```assembly
; Check memory alignment before accessing
mov eax, ebx
and eax, 3 ; check if ebx is 4-byte aligned (lowest 2 bits should be 0)
cmp eax, 0
je aligned
; Handle unaligned memory access - This might involve copying data to a aligned location or using special instructions.
; ...
aligned:
mov eax, [ebx + 0x10]
add eax, [ebx + 0x14]
; Add bounds checking before writing to memory
mov ecx, [some_memory_boundary]
mov edx, ebx
add edx, 0x18
cmp edx, ecx
jl safe_write
; Handle buffer overflow - This might involve reporting an error, returning a status code, etc.
; ...
safe_write:
mov [ebx + 0x18], eax
```
This improved version adds checks to ensure memory alignment and verify the writing address does not cause a buffer overflow.  Error handling (represented by comments) is crucial in a production environment.  The specific handling depends on the application's requirements.
